<p>Hi! This is my personal website! I'm a 19-year-old digital creator and fighter for privacy and data protection who has always been fascinated by design and development. <br />It all started when I built my first website on my school's intranet, and since then, my passion has only grown stronger. I'm skilled in coding and UX/UI design; I love pushing the boundaries of what's possible and strive to create visually appealing and user-friendly products that make a lasting impression. <br />When I'm not designing and coding, I enjoy exploring the latest web design trends as well as spending some time outside or with friends. You can learn more about me by clicking on the following topics.</p>

<p>Privacy and data protection a lot of my time. I advocate better privacy through data security and a principle of minimal data collection. The right to privacy -especially online- is an important thing for me. I want everyone to be able to manage, delete and own their data.<br />To achieve this, I have made a conscious decision not to use Google and Microsoft services and strive to make my digital life as data-friendly as possible. <br />While it may be tempting to choose convenience over privacy, I believe that protecting my and others' personal data should be a top priority in today's digital world. <br />By paying attention to the tools and services I use online, I can ensure that my data remains secure and protected from unwanted intrusion. For this reason, I recommend using ad- and tracking-free open-source products.</p>

<button class="collapsible">Photography & Travel</button>
<div class="collapsible-content">
<p>I love exploring new places and traveling. It's so exciting to see the unknown and discover all the incredible sights and experiences that different destinations have to offer. <br />One of my favorite things to do while traveling is photograph beautiful experiences. I especially love capturing architecture and nature. <br />For me, photography is a way to freeze a moment in time and capture it forever. It allows me to capture the beauty of the world around us and share those experiences with others.</p><a class="button" href="/showcase">Photography</a>
