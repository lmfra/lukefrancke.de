<h3>Collection of general information when visiting my website</h3>
<h4>Type and purpose of processing:</h4>
<p>When you visit my website, your browser systematically sends certain information to the server. These are necessary for a connection between the end device and the server. The web hosting provider stores this data of the accesses in a log file. The legal basis for the data processing is Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR. My legitimate interest follows from listed purposes for data collection. I never use the collected data for the purpose of drawing conclusions about your person.</p>
 <p>The following data is stored:</p>
<ul>
<li>IP address (anonymized, e.g. 192.168.xxx.xxx)</li>
<li>randomly created ID of the access (x-lima-id)</li>
<li>request method (GET)</li>
<li>HTTP status code (e.g. 200)</li>
</ul>
<p>The following data is stored, but is generally not personal data in the sense of the GDPR:</p>
<ul>
<li>User-Agent-Header (e.g. Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/108.0.0.0 Safari/537.36)</li>

<ul>
<li>Ensuring a problem-free connection of the website,</li>
<li>Ensuring the use of my website,</li>
</ul>
<p>I do not use your data to draw conclusions about your person. Information of this kind may be collected by my web hosting provider lima-city in order to secure the website and the technology behind it. However, the collected logs may be used and disclosed upon order of a court of law, upon request by an investigative authority, or for evidentiary purposes.</p>
<p><span class="strong">Legal basis and legitimate interest:</span></p>
<p>The processing is carried out in accordance with Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. f GDPR on the basis of my legitimate interest in ensuring the security and functionality of my website.</p>

<p><span class="strong">Storage period:</span></p>
<p>The log data is currently stored for 7 days or less. The data is only read out in the event of explicit security risks, attacks, hacks, authority requests or technical problems.</p>
<p><span class="strong">Mandatory or required provision:</span></p>
<p>The provision of the aforementioned personal data is neither required by law nor by contract. However, without the log files, the service and functionality of my website is not guaranteed. In addition, individual services and services may not be available or limited. For this reason, a contradiction is excluded.</p>

<h3>Security and Performance</h3>
<h4 id="servers">Server locations and server providers</h4>
<p>I process your personal data exclusively in data centers in the Federal Republic of Germany and are therefore subject to European as well as German (data protection) laws. The provider of the servers used is currently lima-city of TrafficPlex GmbH. The servers of this site are currently located in Telehouse data center, Frankfurt am Main, Germany. The server provider has no access to the data on the server operated by us and accordingly no access to personal data of the users. The provider has contractually agreed to maintain confidentiality about data generated in network traffic.</p>
<p>I have concluded a data processing agreement with my web hosting provider. This is a contract required by data protection laws, which ensures that this provider only processes the personal data of my website visitors in accordance with my instructions and in compliance with the legislation of data protection laws.</p>
<h3 id="contact">Contact with E-Mail or other services</h2>
<p><span class="strong">Nature and purpose of processing:</span></p>
<p>The data you enter will be stored for the purpose of individual communication with you. For this purpose, it is necessary to provide a valid e-mail address or Messenger ID. We can also collect IP-addresses, contact details like email-addresses or data you entered. This serves the assignment of the request and the subsequent response to the same. The provision of further data is optional.</p>
<p><span class="strong">Legal basis:</span></p>
<p>The processing of the data entered is based on a legitimate interest (Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR).<br />The information you provide will be stored for the purpose of processing the request and for possible follow-up questions. This can include IP-addresses, contact details like email-addresses or data you entered.</p>
<p><span class="strong">Recipients:</span></p>
<p>Recipients of the data: Luke Francke,<br />E-mail: collected and stored through web hosting provider Lima City (ruled through <a href="#servers">data processing agreement</a>),<br />or messenger service provider Threema (<a href="https://threema.ch/privacy_policy/">privacy policy</a><span class="external-icon"></span>)</p>
<p><span class="strong">Storage period:</span></p>
<p>Data will be deleted no later than 3 months after finished processing the request.<br />If a contractual relationship arises, I am subject to the statutory retention periods under the German Commercial Code (HGB) and delete your data after these periods have expired.</p>
<p><span class="strong">Provision mandatory or required:</span></p>
<p>The provision of your personal data is voluntary. However, I can only process your request if you provide me with e-mail address and the content of the request. For external service providers (like Threema), you need to check the provider's privacy policy for detailed information.</p>
<p><span class="strong">SSL Encryption</span></p>
<p>In order to protect the security of your data during transmission, I use state-of-the-art encryption methods (e.g. SSL) via HTTPS.</p>
<p><span class="strong">Information about your right of objection according to Art. 21 GDPR</span></p>
<p class="italic">Individual case-related right of objection</p>
<p>You have the right, for reasons arising from your particular situation, to object at any time to the processing of personal data concerning you, which is based on Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR (data processing on the basis of legitimate interests).</p>
<p>If you file an objection, I will no longer process your personal data, unless I can prove compelling reasons worthy of protection for the processing that outweigh your interests, rights and freedoms, or the processing serves to assert, exercise or defend legal claims.</p>
