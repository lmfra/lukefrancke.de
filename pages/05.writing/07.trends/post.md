This post is about web design trends that I like and have also used in some projects.

For designs I use myself I have some requirements:

* They should be easy to implement
* They should be easy to customize
* They should be universally applicable
* The user should know what the respective element means and what it is for
* Good readability and contrast

### Large font and full screen size of the menu

I particularly like this trend because the menu is given enough space and links are easy to read. Instead of placing the nav bar small as far as possible at the top of the screen, this takes up most or all of the screen.

### Unusual or customized menu icons

Menu icons are often used to indicate buttons for opening nav menus. Often, menu icons simply represent two or three lines of equal length, some of them are animated when they are getting clicked. However, you can also use customized versions to attract attention and make the design of your website more special.

### Visible grid lines

Grids are used to arrange or align the content of a page. By making them visible, you can bring more contrast to web projects and make them really eye-catching. However, you should keep in mind that this trend can also be seen as confusing by some users. Therefore, think twice before using it.

### Bottom nav bar

This trend is already known from mobile apps and widely used there. It is partially catching for websites as well. A bottom navigation bar allows the user to navigate through pages easily and quickly, as it is always visible and does not need to get clicked for opening a nav menu.
