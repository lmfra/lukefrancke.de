Since October 2020, I had a profile on the social network Parler. Until April 14, 2023. Now that Parler has been sold and shut down, I currently have no place to share my thoughts, stories and pictures.
I liked Parler very much. No other network could provide such a nice community. I also really liked the UI of the site as it was very clean.

I think it's a shame that it has come to this, especially since I do not get along with any big tech network. Other less known networks often have poor UI/UX so this is not an option for me either.
The requirements for a new platform for my content are currently:

* No Big Tech tracking in the app if possible
* Modern looking and simple interface
* Main focus on text content, possibilities to add images/videos or other content

I'm currently considering if it would make sense for me personally to set up my own Mastodon instance. There are some friends that could join in the future. I currently have an account on Mastodon [here](https://hessen.social/@lmfra)<span class="external-icon"></span> and plan to move to [Mozilla Social](https://mozilla.social/)<span class="external-icon"></span> if possible when they enable public access in the future.
