Since some have asked again what devices I currently use in my everyday life I want to share a little update here.

<div class="bordered"><p>This list is just to show which devices, apps and tools I use (daily). I don't want to compare myself with other people, nor do I want to brag about it.</p></div>

## Phone
I am currently using the iPhone SE (2020). I love small phones, I can never really clear with large devices. However, in the future I am considering switching to an iPhone 13 Mini or an iPhone 14.

## iPad
I use an iPad (9th generation) for my daily productivity. I use this in conjunction with an Apple Pencil.

## AirPods
This week I switched from my AirPods 2 to the AirPods Pro. The noise cancelling and the fit have convinced me. The sound is also very good.

## Computer
My computer is still the ASUS F 550 LC. I installed Ubuntu on it last summer, which works great.

## Apps I use
In the following I list some apps that I like to use.

* Tutanota (Premium plan)
* Parler
* Apple Music
* Threema
* Signal
* Proton VPN
* Piped (Web app)
* Hyperweb (for changing my Safari search engine and to block trackers, ads and more)
* Firefox Klar/Focus (as an tracking block extension for Safari)
* satellite (for making calls)
* DeepL
* Raindrop.io

## Nextcloud
I use a self-hosted Nextcloud for files and organization.

## Sound
I use a Soundcore Motion Q for my music in addition to my AirPods.
